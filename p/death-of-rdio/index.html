              <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/16/9746220/pandora-to-acquire-key-parts-of-rdio">Rdio has died</a>.<br/><br/>

            If you, like me, were a relatively content user of Rdio
            this news was met with a hearty groan. So began the
            great migration. What follows is an account of what it's
            like to switch to a new streaming service. 
            (<span class="roboto_m">Short answer</span>: it's rather
            unpleasant).
            <br/><br/>

            <div class="post">Step 1. How do I get my music out of here?</div>
            I'd wager that any person who is both a streaming music
            service subscriber and considers themselves a connoisseur
            of music has played out this scenario in their mind a
            number of times. I think I, and those in the boat with me,
            just irrationally hoped it would never come to this. So it
            goes.<br/><br/>

            So, how do you get your music out? The answer depends a
            bit on what type of music consumer you are. Crudely, I've
            found that there are generally two camps:
            <br/><br/>
            <ol>
              <li>Playlist people</li>
              <li>Album people</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
            I think these two camps are fairly self-explanatory, but
            here it is anyway. Playlist people make playlists, seek
            out other playlists, pick out "radio stations" and listen
            to music that way. Album people, by contrast, amass large
            libraries of albums and generally listen to music an album
            at a time. I've found that most streaming music services
            seem to cater more toward playlist people. Bucking this
            trend (in concert with its great design and actually
            useful social features) was what made Rdio appealing in
            the first place. Speaking of lessons to be learned (and
            features to be borrowed) from Rdio, I enjoyed <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/24/9789132/things-spotify-should-steal-from-rdio">this
            article.</a><br/><br/>

            Needless to say, I'm an album person. So the <a href="http://www.ivyishere.org/">tools available</a>
            that attempt to transfer your music from one streaming
            service to another (note: by "transfer your music," I mean
            "crudely dump all your playlists over" and by "to
            another," I mean Spotify) are of little use to me. I need
            my album collection moved over and I need it done
            meticulously.<br/><br/>

            After a respectable amount of Googling and testing out
            random transfer services, I decided that the best I could
            do was to make sure I had an accurate record of all my
            music to later check against. Luckily there exists just
            the thing to do this! The wonderful Chrome extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rdio-enhancer/hmaalfaappddkggilhahaebfhdmmmngf?hl=en">Rdio
            Enhancer</a>. It has a number of handy features, but of
            interest now is its "Export to CSV" functionality. This
            does just what you think it does. Exports your entire
            "Favorites" collection to a <code>.csv</code> file. From
            some of Rdio's official statements on its demise, I
            wouldn't be surprised if they offered something similar
            themselves, but only time will tell.<br/><br/>

            <div class="post">Step 2. Scope the alternatives</div>
            If you haven't you've been keeping up with the streaming
            music landscape, here are the worthy contenders:
            <br/><br/>
            <ul>
              <li>Tidal</li>
              <li>Apple Music</li>
              <li>Spotify</li>
              <li>Google Play Music</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            
            <span class="roboto_m">Tidal's</span> marquee features are
            its lossless streaming option (for more money) and all the
            exclusive content brought to you by Jay-Z. While I like
            Jay-Z as much as the next guy, I don't really care about
            this exclusive stuff and to be honest, I don't believe
            it'll stand the test of time. 
            <strike>Tidal</strike><br/><br/>

            <span class="roboto_m">Apple Music</span>, from all I've
            read, has a fairly nice feature set, but is a bit of a
            mess UX-wise. Beats 1 radio is definitely intriguing, even
            if I'm not sure I'd use it much. But none of that matters,
            because I use Android and though I know they're supposed
            to be coming out with an Android app sometime, that's not
            good enough and doesn't bode well for the future.
            <strike>Apple Music</strike><br/><br/>

            <span class="roboto_m">Spotify</span> has garnered itself
            near-total mindshare. It <span class="roboto_m">is</span>
            music streaming to a large portion of the population. It
            also supposedly has the largest collection (though at this
            point they all seem roughly the same to me). I like some
            aspects of Spotify's interface and find others pretty
            annoying. Best feature of all, though: <span class="roboto_i">They
            have a Linux client!</span> It's of questionable
            design/quality, but just the fact that it exists at all is
            worthy of mountains of praise. Ultimately, however, as
            more and more artists keep their music off Spotify (and
            others), I need a service that has an escape hatch for
            these situations. <strike>Spotify</strike>
            <br/><br/> 

            Thus, <span class="roboto_m">Google Play Music All Access</span> 
            (aka. <span class="roboto_m">Google Music</span>),
            won out. I have some serious qualms with numerous aspects
            of its UX/design (which I plan to lay out in a future
            post), but its feature depth is just too good to pass up.
            Enumerated, they are:<br/><br/>
            <ol>
              <li>Storage locker for your own uploaded music</li>
              <li>Solid Android, iOS and Web apps</li>
              <li>YouTube Red subscription as a bonus</li>
              <li>Ability to buy albums and add them to your collection</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
            By the way, for fellow Linux users who don't want to have
            to have their streaming service open in another tab (which
            I personally find rather annoying), take a look at <a href="https://tiliado.eu/nuvolaplayer/repository/">Nuvola Player</a>.
            It's not a perfect solution, but it's a pretty good one. 
            <br/><br/>

            <div class="post">Step 3. Transfer Music</div>
            I wish I was about to spend this section detailing how,
            given the <code>.csv</code> I generated back in 
            <span class="roboto_m">Step 1</span>, I built an awesome
            tool based off of <a href="https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi">gmusicapi</a> 
            that automated a large amount of this soul-crushing step.
            Had I a bit more patience and foresight, perhaps I would
            be. Sadly, I went about it the old fashioned way -- I
            don't recommend it.
            <br/><br/>

            I did poke around the <code>gmusicapi</code> enough (it's
            Python!), however, to put together a rough sketch of what
            I think it would take. If you're curious, here's the
            general overview (I'll be sure to update this post
            with any progress I make toward actually building it):
            <br/><br/>
            <ol>
              <li>Create a <b><code>MobileClient</code></b> and login to your account</li>
              <li>Take your <b><code>.csv</code></b> you created and load it in, using something like <b><code>csv.DictReader</code></b></li>
              <li>For each artist, search for them with <b><code>search_all_access()</code></b>. This will give a dictionary with tons of results, you're looking for 'artist_hits'.</li>
              <li>Assuming they have the artist, get their info with <b><code>get_artist_info()</code></b>, with the 'artist_id' you got in the last step. Make sure to have it 'include albums'.</li>
              <li>For each album you have in your <b><code>.csv</code></b>, match them up with the albums available. For each matching album, keep track of its 'album_id'.</li>
              <li>For each album_id, get the songs (and their 'id's) with <b><code>get_album_info()</code></b> (making sure to 'include songs').</li>
              <li>For all songs on each album, use <b><code>add_aa_track()</code></b> to actually add it to your Google Music library. (This seems like a convoluted way to add an album, but I didn't see a better one immediately).</li>
            </ol>
            <br/>
            
            Now, since I haven't actually attempted to do this yet,
            take this all with a grain of salt. That said, I don't
            think it should be too bad.
            <br/><br/>

            Happy migrating!
