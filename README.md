It doesn't have a name (yet) and it doesn't have much of a theme, but I like it anyway.

Thanks to the way that Github user pages and project pages are laid out, it seems as though they are one, which is nice. Adds a bit of code duplication, but keeps things cleaner in terms of separation of concerns. 

Hopefully I'll keep up with it.
